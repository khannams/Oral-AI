# WebScraping and downloading Images using R-Selenium

Typical lesion images were required to train the AI in diagnoses. Textbook and published colour Atlases of oral lesions were considered as reliable sources for such images. Keeping in mind the project I was working on, I decided to download images from the following sources:
1. A digital manual for the early diagnosis of oral neoplasia(1)
2. Color Atlas of Oral Diseases: Diagnosis and Treatment 
3. Pocket Atlas of Oral Diseases

This repository contains the R code to scrape all information associated with every image in these sources, along with downloading images.
To accomplish this, I used the package Selenium.
